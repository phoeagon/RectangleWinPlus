Privacy Policy
==========================

Last Updated: Nov 23, 2025

Overview

This application (“the App”) is developed and provided by phoeagon software. We take privacy seriously.
This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles data and describes your rights related to its use.

## Personal Data Collection

The App does not collect, store, access, process, or transmit any personal information, whether directly or indirectly.

+ No account creation is required.
+ No analytics, telemetry, or usage tracking is performed.
+ No personal identifiers (such as name, email, IP address, device ID, etc.) are accessed or transmitted by the App.

## Access to Public Information

Some features in the App allow users to access publicly available information hosted on third-party platforms, such as GitHub.

+ Any such information is publicly accessible data already made available by the platform or its users.
+ The App only retrieves information at the user’s request and does not modify, store, or redistribute
data retrieved from GitHub or any other external service.
+ phoeagon software does not control the accuracy, availability, or policies of GitHub or any third-party service.

## Third-Party Services

If you choose to use features that open or fetch information from third-party websites or services, your use of
those services is subject to their respective terms and privacy policies. The App does not mediate or interfere with such interactions.

## Data Security

Because the App does not collect or transmit personal data, no user data is stored by us. However, any external
services you use through the App may handle information according to their own security practices.

## Children’s Privacy

The App does not collect personal data from users of any age, including children. It is not designed to attract
or target children specifically.

## Changes to This Policy

If the App’s functionality changes in a way that affects privacy, this Privacy Policy will be updated and made
available through the Microsoft Store listing. Continued use of the App after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
